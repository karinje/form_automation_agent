# Form Structure Analyzer Maintenance Guide

## Critical Components and Common Pitfalls

### 1. Element Selection Strategy
**Reference**: `scripts/analyze_form_structure.py:73-75`

- **DO**: Use specific selectors based on analyzable types
- **DON'T**: Use broad selectors like 'input, select, textarea'
- **WHY**: Broad selectors capture unwanted elements (submit buttons, hidden fields)

### 2. Exclude Pattern Application
**Reference**: `scripts/analyze_form_structure.py:294-334`

- **DO**: 
  - Include excluded fields (day, month, year) in initial collection
  - Only apply exclude patterns during recursive analysis
- **DON'T**: 
  - Filter out excluded patterns from initial shows/hides lists
  - Apply exclude patterns too early in the process

### 3. Radio Button State Management
**Reference**: `scripts/analyze_form_structure.py:240-250`

- **DO**:
  - Reset state by clicking opposite radio button first
  - Wait for state changes between clicks
  - Handle both Y/N options consistently
- **DON'T**:
  - Assume clicking one option automatically unsets others
  - Skip state reset between analyses

### 4. Element Type Determination
- **DO**:
  - Use getAttribute('type') for radio buttons
  - Handle select elements consistently with 'select-one'
  - Include full element details in state tracking
- **DON'T**:
  - Rely on el.type property alone
  - Mix type determination methods

### 5. Dependency Recording
**Reference**: `scripts/analyze_form_structure.py:336-343`

- **DO**:
  - Include full field details in shows/hides
  - Maintain consistent format with fields section
  - Track recursive dependencies properly
- **DON'T**:
  - Store only element IDs
  - Lose field metadata in dependency chains

### 6. State Comparison
- **DO**:
  - Use offsetParent for visibility checks
  - Compare full element state, not just presence
  - Handle both appearance and disappearance
- **DON'T**:
  - Rely solely on DOM presence
  - Ignore element visibility state

### 6.1 Element Details Preservation
**Reference**: `scripts/analyze_form_structure.py:338-403`

- **DO**:
  - Keep all element detail extraction logic when modifying state tracking
  - Preserve text_phrase extraction
  - Maintain field type-specific details (maxlength, options, etc.)
  - Keep radio button grouping logic
- **DON'T**:
  - Remove element detail collection when updating visibility checks
  - Lose field metadata during state comparison updates
  - Skip type-specific property collection
  - Break radio button relationship tracking
  - Delete text_phrase extraction code when modifying element queries
  - Remove element details population code below text_phrase extraction

**Common Mistake**: When updating element visibility or state tracking logic, accidentally removing the text_phrase extraction and element details population code that follows. Always preserve:

### 7. Recursive Analysis
- **DO**:
  - Properly chain dependencies
  - Maintain state between recursive calls
  - Handle nested form structures
- **DON'T**:
  - Create infinite recursion loops
  - Lose parent-child relationships

### 8. JavaScript Evaluation
- **DO**:
  - Use template literals consistently
  - Escape selectors properly
  - Handle async state changes
- **DON'T**:
  - Mix string interpolation styles
  - Ignore JavaScript context

## Testing Changes

1. Always test with:
   - Radio button chains (Y/N sequences)
   - Nested dependencies
   - Fields with exclude patterns
   - All analyzable field types

2. Verify output:
   - Complete field details in shows/hides
   - Proper recursive dependencies
   - Correct handling of excluded patterns
   - Accurate state tracking

## Common Issues

1. Missing Dependencies:
   - Check state reset between analyses
   - Verify click event handling
   - Ensure proper wait times

2. Wrong Field Types:
   - Verify type determination logic
   - Check selector specificity
   - Validate type conversion

3. Incomplete State Tracking:
   - Verify visibility checks
   - Validate state comparison logic
   - Check recursive state handling

## Future Modifications

When modifying the analyzer:
1. Maintain type safety through AnalyzableElementType
2. Keep exclude pattern logic consistent
3. Preserve recursive exploration capability
4. Maintain field detail consistency
5. Consider form state management
6. Handle async operations properly

## Performance Considerations

1. Minimize page evaluations
2. Use efficient selectors
3. Optimize wait times
4. Handle large form structures
5. Consider memory usage in recursive operations

1. Change requied for input and output data to fill form through yaml. When yaml has a - following an indentation, for example structure attached, that means that its a list of group of fields. 

2. The first list element should be used to fill all the fields on the page as we would with any other indedent group. 

3. Then to fill second list element code should click on add group element that we added.

4. Then the new copy of fields in the group generated on the web page should be filled by fields in the second list item and so on for third element if it exists etc.  

5. Only when hypen exists its ok to assume this might be a add group case and make the yaml to form filling and vice verse work based on this logic. 

6. For the second set of fields, to get the form field you need to replace _ctl00 with _ctl01 for second set of fields and so on..since the clt that occurs at begining of the name should be ignored (not replaced) but the one that occurs after _ should be replaced. Also, the add group needs to be clicked by the script when it detect multiple items in list of input yaml. Do you know how to reconize teh correponding add group and click? 

7. This logic should be generic and not hard coded to the previous travel page example we are testing currently. I've attached input yaml @ds160_from_o1.yaml 

8. This shoudl be the sequence :yaml upload -> yaml to formdata mapping taking into account array entries for add group -> if array exists on yaml for that element find "Add Group" button during filling the form (since only the the button becomes visible not upfrontt)

10. Add extensive console logging ONLY for the previous travel page only such that even if youre attempt failed, you gather great insight on what to do next. This is so that we arent overwhelmed by loggin on other pages for now

11. Previously you've made this mistake where the mappings for  previous_travel_details become a string : [object, Object] instead of the actual object. 
    So double check that flattening of array to string doesnt occur at any level (analyze entire chain from yaml to mapping formation) 

12. Pay special attention to these while enable above functionality:
a. Dont break the add group / remove group functionality. 
b. Dont break functionality of handling depencies recrusively and boundary box rendering around dependencies. 
c. Look at yaml in @form_data (3).yaml -> previous_travel_page -> previous_travel_details -> arrival -> month, day, year. This is an example of add group. 
d. Dont introduce new input mappings, you can manipulate mappings once you read input mapping however you see fit but dont suggest changing input mapping itself. 
e. When you suggest a fix no previous changes should break. 


 13. Give me a high level summary of what you plan to do and verify all changes in the end step by step 
 
 14. Verify that all requirements in this file are met before proceed to code with user permission 
 
 15. Latest console log is save in @logs/console_debug.json and overwritten with latest data every time we run it.

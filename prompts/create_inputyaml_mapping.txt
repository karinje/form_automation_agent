Here the set of steps you need to follow:
1. The json file is structured such that dependencies store which elements get revealed/hidden based on particular values for various elements. Dependencies are recursive. Parse the json file to figure out which inputs will trigger the maximum number of dependencies to be revealed (because we want to test an input that touches most elements). 

2. Then figure out the input values to be provided in the @full_application.yaml that will reveal the most elements (provide names of input that reasonably match the json based on text phrase/parents text phrase/element name). 

3. Next update relevant section in @full_application.yaml with inputs that accomplish 2. 

4. Next update the form_mapping dict in FormMapping class in the file @form_mapping.py for this page such that elements are mapped consistently between @full_application.yaml and @form_mapping.py 

5. Follow these naming conventions strictly:
   - In YAML: Use page_name format (e.g., personal_page1, travel_page)
   - In form_mapping.py: Use UPPERCASE format (e.g., PERSONAL1, TRAVEL)
   - Only add numeric suffix (like _page1, _page2 or 1, 2) when the page type repeats
   - For date fields, always split into separate month/day/year fields:
     YAML example: arrival_month: "JUN", arrival_day: "15", arrival_year: "2024"
     Not: arrival_date: "2024-06-15"
   - In form_mapping.py, do NOT use page name as prefix:
     Correct: "purpose_of_trip": "field_id"
     Wrong: "page_name.purpose_of_trip": "field_id"
   - In YAML, put page fields under the page type:
     Correct:
       page_name:
         field1: "value"
         field2: "value"
     Wrong:
       page_name:
         page_name:
           field1: "value"
   - Keep nested structure flat in form_mapping.py using dots:
     Correct: "parent.child": "field_id"
     Wrong: "parent": { "child": "field_id" }
   - For phone numbers, remove all spaces and hyphens:
     Correct: "442012345678"
     Wrong: "+44-20-1234-5678"
   - For location/address fields, always include city, state/province, and country when present in the JSON:
     Correct:
       issuance_location:
         city: "London"
         state: "Greater London"
         country: "UNITED KINGDOM"
     Wrong:
       issuance_location:
         city: "London"
         country: "UNITED KINGDOM"

6. Once completed, review each input step by step for consistency between all files.

7. Don't make any other unnecessary changes; provide full code snippets don't truncate with ...etc...

@full_application.yaml @form_mapping.py and provided input json.

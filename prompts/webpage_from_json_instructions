Here's how reach of pages that are created from the json files in @form_definitions folder should behave in terms of responding to user selection

1. All the fields in the "fields" list of cooresponding json file should be visible to the user when the page is loaded.
Example:
Here's an example of how these instuctions map to @form_definitions/p5_previoustravel_definition.json
When the page is loaded the fields list is rendered.
["name": "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblPREV_US_TRAVEL_IND",
 "name": "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblPREV_VISA_IND",
 "name": "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblPREV_VISA_REFUSED_IND",
 "name": "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblVWP_DENIAL_IND",
 "name": "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblIV_PETITION_IND",
 ]
 
2. The attributes of each element in the "fields" list should be used to determine the behaviour of the element in the webpage.
3. The values of the fields should be used to populate the fields in the webpage. For radio buttons, the values are usually Y and N as per the json file.For dropdowns, the values are specified in the "options" list.The maxlength attribute should be used to limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field. The maxlenght and has_na shoudl also be taken into account when populating the fields.
4. Next, the "dependencies" list should be used to determine which fields should be shown to the user based on the user's selection. The "shows" list should be used to show the fields that should be shown to the user. The "hides" list should be used to hide the fields that should not be shown to the user.
5. For radio buttons, the "button_ids" list should be used to determine the name of the radio button option that should be selected.This should should be appended to the name of the option chosen to form the key for the field in the dependencies list.
6. For dropdowns, the key is created by appending the name of the option chosen to the name of the dropdown 
7. Next, when a user selection is made, the key needs to be constructed and dependencies should be parsed to render every element in the shows list and hide every element in the hides list.
Example:
Here's an example of how these instuctions map to @form_definitions/p5_previoustravel_definition.json
WHen user selected "Y" for "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblPREV_US_TRAVEL_IND", the cooresponding button_ids is parsed to select the button id which is
"ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_rblPREV_US_TRAVEL_IND_0" then the value "Y" is appended to find the key. 
The correponding dependencies for this key are parsed which are:

8. These new fields need to be rendered just below the parent that was selected and elements that existed before need to be pushed down. 
9. When the selection is toggled by changing the value of a field, the key needs to be constructed its dependencies should be parsed and previously shown dependencies for the other value should be hidden.
When I toggle back to "ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_rblPREV_US_TRAVEL_IND_0.N" the elements for this key need to shown and previous shows from "ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_rblPREV_US_TRAVEL_IND_0.Y" need to go away.

10. When a user makes a selection on newly shown fields from dependencies shows, the key needs to be constructed that fields depenencies list needs to be parsed an rendered similar to how we did it for earlier level. The dependencies list from the same level should be parsed and rendered.
Now from the newly shown fields, I make the selection "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblPREV_US_DRIVER_LIC_IND" = Y in which case the shows for key "ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_rblPREV_US_DRIVER_LIC_IND_0.Y" needs to be parsed which and these two fields need to be come visible:
"shows": [

11. So we need to recursively parse the dependencies list and render the fields.
The above logic of parsing dependencies and rendering fields needs to be done for each level of the dependencies list.

12. When a parent field value is toggled such that a child field becomes hidden, all the children of that child field should be hidden.
Now if I select "ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_rblPREV_US_TRAVEL_IND_0.N" all its child dependencies and their children should be hidden. 
In this case, first level child such as "ctl00$SiteContentPlaceHolder$FormView1$rblPREV_US_DRIVER_LIC_IND" and its children such as "ctl00_SiteContentPlaceHolder_FormView1_dtlUS_DRIVER_LICENSE_ctl00_tbxUS_DRIVER_LICENSE" should be hidden.

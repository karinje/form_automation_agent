            Rules:
                1. Use Y/N for yes/no fields
                2. Use true/false for boolean fields (like _na fields)
                3. Use 3-letter format for months (JAN, FEB, etc.)
                4. Preserve any special characters in names/addresses
                5. Use empty string "" for missing values
                6. Keep array structures for repeated elements (other_names, travel_companions, etc.)
                7. Include button_clicks arrays as shown in template
                8. Maintain exact field names and hierarchy
                9. DO NOT wrap the page sections again - they already have their page names (like personal_page1:, address_phone_page:)
                10. Follow the instructions provided as comments in the yaml files.
                11. Every value should be a string, except boolean values can be true/false. 

            Example format:
            personal_page1:
                surname: "SMITH"
                given_name: "JOHN"
                # ... rest of fields

            address_phone_page:
                home_address:
                    street1: "123 MAIN ST"
                # ... rest of fields
